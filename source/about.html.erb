Nick is    the proud caretaker of a thriving sourdough start, a stark proponent of writing    about one's self in the third person, and likes to divide    his time evenly between writing code in a dark cave-like lair and outside enjoying    the fresh air and sunshine.â€‹ Nick has always been interested in math, science,    and technology in nearly every domain, and is alwasys striving to learn just a    bit more about the world around him.  </p>
